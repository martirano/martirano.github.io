<h2>I-80 Avant-Garde</h2>
<h5><i>A review by Kyle Gann, printed in the November 17, 1987 
issue of the Village Voice.</i></h5>
<hr>

<p>This intrepid experimentalism, grounded in a technique that can 
be taken for granted, was what made Salvatore Martirano's October 
12 concert at Roulette so exciting intellectually, sensually, 
and musically.  Martirano was one reason for the University of 
Illinois's luster in the '60s, but while he's been with the school
for 24 years, he's no academic; 12-tone vestiges survive in his
music, but fused with the spirits of jazz and theater.  That so
important a composer would appear in New York at Roulette was a
fitting homage, for Roulette, the point of legitimate entry into
the New York music scene, itself an Urbana transplant.</p>

<p>The concert opener evinced both the technique and the excitement.
<i>Sampler: everything goes when the whistle blows</i>, for violin
and tape, bore a typically whimsical Martirano title, and was 
intended (the composer said) to suggest "how rude life can be."
This was a ruggen contest between instrument and machine, dramatized
by the passionate, expert playing of violinist Dorothy Martirano (the
composer's wife).  Violin and computerized klangs ran circles around
each other with fuguelike vigor, and the violinist endured a series
of jarring interruptions from the machine, which seemed determined to 
break her spirit.  The attempt failed, and they ended together on a
last, mournful octave.</p>

<p>Martirano's theater piece L's G.A. (Lincoln's Gettysburg Address) 
for film projectors, tape, "helium bomb, and gas masked politico,"
is the Midwest's <i>Le Sacre.</i>  Martirano revived a fraction of its
chutzpah with a three-monitor video version called <i>L's G.A. Update
:</i> a perfect title, because it was to the original what the '80s 
are to the '60s, smaller and less shocking.  Sonically, the work's
rocket roars, elephant squeals, and reinterpretation of Lincoln's words
in an exaggerated JFK voice made a mosaic of '60s protest.  Visually, the 
images were vitiated by miniaturization: it was difficult to see the toy 
tanks moving on a nude woman's body, and the distorted images of TV 
newscasters were more cute than troubling.  But the piece's concluding 
Muzak, painting a postholocaust world in which Reaganesque spokesmen 
still insist nothing is wrong, was as chilling as ever.</p>

<p>Dorothy Martirano played another work with tape by North Texas State's 
Larry Austin.  <i>Montage</i> was free of the Cagean conceptualism that 
marks Austin's more expansive works: the violin began with soulful two-note 
motives, the computer tape responding with pensive near-tonality.  In most 
such pieces, the instrumentalist holds everthing together while the 
electronics run wild, but here the case was refreshingly opposite: Martirano's 
impassioned doublestops feigned impatience with the tape's statley sostenuto 
counterpoint.  I don't think of Austin as an emotionally affective composer, 
but <i>Montage</i> was one of the most moving instrument-and-tape pieces 
I've heard.</p> 

<p>S. Martirano's <i>Robot</i> was the evening's virtuosic and conceptual 
climax.  The core of <i>Robot</i> is a computer program (Martirano calls 
it "artificial stupidity") designed to improvise on materials fed into 
the computer by the two Martiranos on violin and DX-7.  At first, like a 
sleeping giant woken only with difficulty, the computer played in unison 
with the violin,  adding buzzes and cymbals to each note.  Gradually it 
began to create its own contrapuntal lines, reacting with complex canons 
that reminded me of Dufay's points of imitation: each DX-7 motive echoed 
in various configurations, then gave away to another.  Finally the machine 
was so full of information that the duo paused to let it play itself out, 
and, as they watched, it erupted in a furious coda of crashing chords, 
a spontanious, computerized <i>Eroica</i>.</p>

<p>The generalization of the principles of <i>Sampler</i> needed to create 
<i>Robot's</i> cogent improv revealed a breathtaking quality of compositional 
thought.  That such thought is less celebrated in prestigious music circles 
than that of Babbitt and Wuorinen seems to indicate geographical prejudice 
as well as a disparity in self-promotional talent.  (Martirano's wife relates 
that she found an unopened letter, dated eight years before, inviting him 
to write a tape piece for the opening of Lincoln Center.) Whatever the case, 
this concert was an overdue New York reminder that Sal Martirano is one of 
our most astonishing composers.</p>
