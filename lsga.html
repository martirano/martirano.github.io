      <p class="tm-about-description tm-highlight-text">"...this is not a verbal analog or a description of the composition but a literary companion to it, complete in itself.  Perhaps it should be read a day or two before or immediatley after one hears the music.  LsGA was chosen for  one simple reason: of the approximately two hundred mixed media works that were considered for a series presenting only two concerts a season, Martirano's savage, tender and elegantly crafted work proved the most artistically successful...  If one is shocked, stunned and , in the conclusion, edified by this powerful experiential statement, one is then made aware, through art, of a very creative exposition of today's Weltanschauung.  This work goes far beyond the possible "campy" interpretation of its title (a wrong interpretation) into regions of terrifying violence and equally vivifying hope.  From Monteverdi to the work under discussion,  the theatre piece of any consequence aims for the solar plexus, delivering a haymaker.   Martirano not only delivers the haymaker, but presents us with a deus ex tempore who haymakes the haymaker." --From a statement by Charles Whittenberg, (Music Director University of Connecticut Nov 17,1969)</p>
